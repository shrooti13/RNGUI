Notes for BeautifulSoup

Installed it like so per BS' own instructions:
https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup
* Inside Terminal on the command prompt ran this:
 easy_install beautifulsoup4

* Installed pip like so:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)

https://packaging.python.org/installing/
sudo curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3

* The installation of BeautifulSoup was buggy because i got an older version. So I did:
pip uninstall bs4
pip install beautifulsoup....whl (from inside the Downloads folder)

and now the bs4 programs are working. :D yay!!

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14369447/how-to-save-back-changes-made-to-a-html-file-using-beautifulsoup-in-python

Now print(soup.prettify()) will show changed links. To save the changes to a file:

htmlDoc.close()

html = soup.prettify("utf-8")
with open("output.html", "wb") as file:
    file.write(html)
