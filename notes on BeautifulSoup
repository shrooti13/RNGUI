Notes for BeautifulSoup

Installed it like so per BS' own instructions:
https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup
* Inside Terminal on the command prompt ran this:
 easy_install beautifulsoup4

* Installed pip like so:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)

https://packaging.python.org/installing/
sudo curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3

* The installation of BeautifulSoup was buggy because i got an older version. So I did:
pip uninstall bs4
pip install beautifulsoup....whl (from inside the Downloads folder)

and now the bs4 programs are working. :D yay!!
